## Welcome to AfriqAIr

Africa qualité de l’air (AfriqAir) is a hybrid air quality monitoring and data-sharing network with over 50 low-cost sensors and reference-grade monitors. The sensors are mainly located in urban areas across 11 African countries. 

## Our research objectives

Research objectives include evaluation of sensor performance across the different climates in Africa, integration of ground sensor data with satellite data to expand spatial data coverage, verification of air quality models, and investigation of air pollution health effects.
